This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

You can find the most recent version of the create react app guide [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

## Setup

- Install brew
- Install yarn (run `brew install yarn`)
- Clone the repo
- Install dependencies (run `yarn`)

## Run the app locally

- Run `yarn start`

## Deploy the app

- The app is built to be easily deployed via cdn.
- If you push a branch to github, netlify will build you a branch preview (look for the netlify integration on a pull request)
- When you merge to master, netlify builds to the dev server (https://take-back-day.netlify.com/)
- For more info about deployment, look in the [deploy readme](https://github.com/cgalbiati/take-back-day-microsite/blob/master/Deploy.md).
